# Object_relational_mapperORM

ORMs provide a high-level abstraction upon a relational database that allows a developer to write Python code instead of SQL to create, read, update and delete data and schemas in their database. Developers can use the programming language they are comfortable with to work with a database instead of writing SQL statements or stored procedures.

Speed up web application development, especially at the beginning of a project. The potential development speed boost comes from not having to switch from Python code into writing declarative paradigm SQL statements

Python ORM Implementations
There are numerous ORM implementations written in Python, including

SQLAlchemy
Peewee
The Django ORM
PonyORM
SQLObject
Tortoise ORM (source code)

SQLAlchemy is a well-regarded Python ORM because it gets the abstraction level "just right" and seems to make complex database queries easier to write than the Django ORM in most cases.

SQLAlchemy:
The mapping allows SQLAlchemy to handle the underlying database so developers can work with their Python objects instead of writing bridge code to get data in and out of relational tables.
